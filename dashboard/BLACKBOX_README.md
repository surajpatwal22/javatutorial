Sure, I can do that. Here is the README.md file for the code:

## Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard that displays key metrics and charts.

### Prerequisites

To run this dashboard, you will need the following:

* Node.js
* NPM

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Running the Dashboard

To run the dashboard, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Code Explanation

The dashboard is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main components of the dashboard are the header, the summary cards, and the charts.

The header contains the title of the dashboard and a list of navigation links.

The summary cards display key metrics, such as the total number of users and the total number of orders.

The charts visualize data, such as monthly revenue and sales.

The following code snippets show how to create the header, the summary cards, and the charts:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Dashboard</h1>
  <ul class="nlinks">
    <li>
      <a href="#">Home</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">Products</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">Orders</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</header>
```

```html
<div class="summary-cards">
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Total Users</h2>
    <p>1000</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Total Orders</h2>
    <p>500</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```html
<canvas id="lineChart"></canvas>
<canvas id="barChart"></canvas>
```

I hope this helps!
